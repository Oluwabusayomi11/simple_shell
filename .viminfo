	Unlike PC editors, you cannot replace or delete text by highlighting it with the mouse. Instead use the commands in the following tables.
	Perhaps the most important command is the one that allows you to back up and undo your last action. Unfortunately, this command acts like a toggle, undoing and redoing your most recent action. You cannot go back more than one step.
	*	u	UNDO WHATEVER YOU JUST DID; a simple toggle
	The main purpose of an editor is to create, add, or modify text for a file.
	Inserting or Adding Text
	
	The following commands allow you to insert and add text. Each of these commands puts the vi editor into insert mode; thus, the <Esc> key must be pressed to terminate the entry of text and to put the vi editor back into command mode.
	*	i	insert text before cursor, until <Esc> hit
	 	I	insert text at beginning of current line, until <Esc> hit
	*	a	append text after cursor, until <Esc> hit
	 	A	append text to end of current line, until <Esc> hit
	*	o	open and put text in a new line below current line, until <Esc> hit
	*	O	open and put text in a new line above current line, until <Esc> hit
	Changing Text
	
	The following commands allow you to modify text.
	*	r	replace single character under cursor (no <Esc> needed)
	 	R	replace characters, starting with current cursor position, until <Esc> hit
	 	cw	change the current word with new text, 
	starting with the character under cursor, until <Esc> hit
	 	cNw	change N words beginning with character under cursor, until <Esc> hit; 
	  e.g., c5w changes 5 words
	 	C	change (replace) the characters in the current line, until <Esc> hit
	 	cc	change (replace) the entire current line, stopping when <Esc> is hit
	 	Ncc or cNc	change (replace) the next N lines, starting with the current line,
	stopping when <Esc> is hit
	Deleting Text
	
	The following commands allow you to delete text.
	*	x	delete single character under cursor
	 	Nx	delete N characters, starting with character under cursor
	 	dw	delete the single word beginning with character under cursor
	 	dNw	delete N words beginning with character under cursor; 
	  e.g., d5w deletes 5 words
	 	D	delete the remainder of the line, starting with current cursor position
	*	dd	delete entire current line
	 	Ndd or dNd	delete N lines, beginning with the current line; 
	  e.g., 5dd deletes 5 lines
	Cutting and Pasting Text
	
	The following commands allow you to copy and paste text.
	 	yy	copy (yank, cut) the current line into the buffer
	 	Nyy or yNy	copy (yank, cut) the next N lines, including the current line, into the buffer
	 	p	put (paste) the line(s) in the buffer into the text after the current line
	Other Commands
	
	Searching Text
	
	A common occurrence in text editing is to replace one word or phase by another. To locate instances of particular sets of characters (or strings), use the following commands.
